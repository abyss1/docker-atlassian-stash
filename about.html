    <p>Found a problem with one of the {{site.product.name}} images? Feel free to open a ticket on the {{site.repo.github}} repository on <a href="https://github.com/{{site.author.github}}/{{site.repo.github}}/issues">GitHub</a>, but you should keep a few things in mind:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Use the <a href="https://github.com/{{site.author.github}}/{{site.repo.github}}/search?type=Issues">GitHub issue search</a> to check if your issue has already been reported.</li>
      <li>Try to isolate your problem as much as possible, so we can easily test if
        the issue has been fixed.</li>
      <li>Once you are sure the issue is with the {{site.product.short}} image, and not a third party
        component, <a href="https://github.com/{{site.author.github}}/{{site.repo.github}}/issues/new">submit a ticket</a> to the repository.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can find more information on reporting bugs in the <a href="https://github.com/{{site.author.github}}/{{site.repo.github}}/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs">contributing guide,</a> including tips on what information to include.</p>
